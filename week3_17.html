            CSS Solved a Big Problem.HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
            When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

            CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
